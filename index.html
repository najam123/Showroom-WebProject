			<h1>My Modified Cars</h1>
			<p> The ultimate auto magazine, where all the cars have a focus on function over fads.
			The brand covers tech and how-to performance tuning articles; project cars, engine builds,
			and suspension, tire, wheel, and other upgrades; extensive event coverage and 100's of photos;
			and product buyers guides.</p>
			<h2>Custom Engine Bay </h2>
			<article>
				<img src="images/custom-bay.jpg" alt="custom-bay">
				<p>Smoothing out the sheetmetal around your engine and ditching or tucking away all kinds of
				bits that you don't want seeing the light of day won't make you go any faster. It also won't make your
				car any safer, it won't let it pass an emissions test any easier, and it's on the top of your to-do list
				this side of an unreasonable ride height and rims that cost more than your whole Civic. Execute things right,
				though, and a proper engine bay can make whatever trade-offs you've had to make entirely worth it.</p>

			<h2>More About</h2>
			<p>Know that the 17-year-old with the dumped Integra on Instagram didn't invent the whole idea of a shaved and
			tucked engine bay and you already know half the story. Carburetor-era hot rodders like your grandpappy have been
			smoothing out firewalls and concealing things like brake lines since the days when street racing was a wrist-slapping offense and the
			thought of mandatory smog checks was about as likely as men walking around with hair buns. It's the VW and Honda masses who've turned 
			their engine bays into blank canvases, though, and as it turns out, there's a whole lot more to doing it right than you think.
